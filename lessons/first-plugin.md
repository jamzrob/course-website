So... before we get started.  I hate VimL.  I think its gross.  Its Ugly.  Its
all around unpleasant to write.  This is the primary reason why I use NeoVim,
not Vim.  I can write my plugins in Lua.  

Lua is not bad.  Its a simple language that is extremely boring, which makes it
a great candidate for a scripting language of simple ui elements.

This is meant to show you the power of Vim and its scriptability.  As said, its
better in Lua.

We are going to walk through [Writing Vim Plugin By ≈Åukasz Jan
Niemier](https://vimways.org/2019/writing-vim-plugin/).

### Remember your VimRC?
Start by executing `:h runtimepath`

We need to add to the runtime path a directory to be loaded and it should
contain a folder called `plugin` where we have our plugin located.

```
mkdir -p /path/to/your/plugin/folder
cd /path/to/your/plugin/folder
vim --cmd "set rtp+=$(pwd)" .
```

We have opened up vim and added to the runtime path at opening our current
folder.  This is _a_ way to do this.

You can also install your plugin like any other!

```
... In your vim rc, next to fzf ...
Plug '/absolute/path/to/plugin/folder'
```

But while we are developing, we don't have to have it in either, we can just
execute `:so %` (much like we did in our vim rc).

I'll create it now and you can follow along, PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS.
