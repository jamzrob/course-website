### My slogan for registers

> Definitely hard to imagine them not being hard.

### What is a register?
It is a key -> value

The `key` is a character
The `value` is a string

#### Example time
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-fundamentals/master/course-website/lessons/exercise-5-registers.md > exercise.md && vim exercise.md
```
