* What do you think is the hardest part?  
* What part surprised you the most?
* How do you feel about modes?
* Do you feel that deep down excitement?
* You may not know this yet, but there is some really amazing keys coming up.

#### Vim RC
* You only know a little bit, how will you go about improving it?
* Do they feel confusing?
* Does VimL look ugly (its ok, it does)?

#### File Navgiation
* There are tons of options
* Marks are pretty OP
* File tree is a bit lacking.
