Were are getting to the end game of vim.  There is still so much out there, but
for the sake of surveying, this is where we will end.  We will cover Search and
Replace, Macros, and finally registers.

### Search and Replace
Lets go through a search and replace exercise.  This should help us get the

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-fundamentals/master/course-website/lessons/exercise-3-search-and-replace.md > exercise.md && vim exercise.md
```
