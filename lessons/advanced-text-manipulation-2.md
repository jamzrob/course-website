This is where things can get fun.  Also, they are a bit psychologically
weird...  Meaning, you will find yourself feeling like you don't know how to do

### What is a Macro
A macro simply plays text as motions, inputs, and commands.

#### Let me show you!
I remember my first macro like it was yesterday.....

#### Example time
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-fundamentals/master/course-website/lessons/exercise-4-macros.md > exercise.md && vim exercise.md
```
