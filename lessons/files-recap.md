### Recap
Wow we have learned a lot!  Lets chat about what we have learned.

* NetRW
* `:e`
* `<tab>` and `<C-d>`
* `<C-p>` and `<C-n>` for navigating pop-up lists
* remaps
* marks
* :Vex
* so %
  * more on %.  try typing `:echo expand("%")`  Or `"%p`  What happened here?

How are we feeling?  Do you feel like you have no more room to learn?  I get
that we are sort of on information overload.  Lets take a break and just talk
about what we have learned overall.

### One more thing.  Alternate File

### One more thing.  Jumplist 
I don't think I accidentally talk about this elsewhere.
